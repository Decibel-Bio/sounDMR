\arguments{
\item{methyl_summary}{(df) - the read depth and methylation
change information}

\item{ZoomFrame_filtered}{(df) - the percent methylation information}

\item{experimental_design_df}{(df) - the experimental design}

\item{fixed}{(str) - the fixed effects variables. Note: this
value \strong{cannot} be 'ID'. ID is used to merge data together downstream for
running the model so including the value in the effects will break the model.}

\item{random}{(str) - the random effects variables. Note: this
value \strong{cannot} be 'ID'. ID is used to merge data together downstream for
running the model so including the value in the effects will break the model.}

\item{reads_threshold}{(int) - the number of reads that are each
methylated and unmethylated. This is important since data containing only one
methylated read is unlikely to provide statistical power to our analysis. A
value of 3 here means that the read depth is \emph{at least} the depth provided by
the threshold. Both the methylated and unmethylated samples need a read depth
greater than or equal to this threshold in order to be considered for the model.}

\item{colnames_of_interest}{\emph{optional} (list of strings) - the columns to keep
in the analysis}
